This site contains my research notes.
The notes are mostly on things I am learning or have just learned, possibly re-organized and/or modified according to my personal understanding, so I do not guarantee the correctness of the contents. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch/){:target="_blank"} (EPFL). 
I do researches on machine learning, statistics, convex optimization, and quantum information.

You can find more information about me on [my personal website](https://sites.google.com/site/yenhuanli/){:target="_blank"}
