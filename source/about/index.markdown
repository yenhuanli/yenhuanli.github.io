This site contains my notes on things I know or am learning (which might not be entirely correct!).

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch/){:target="_blank"} (EPFL), working on machine learning, mathematical statistics, optimization theory, and quantum information.

More information about me can be found on [my personal website](https://sites.google.com/site/yenhuanli/){:target="_blank"}
